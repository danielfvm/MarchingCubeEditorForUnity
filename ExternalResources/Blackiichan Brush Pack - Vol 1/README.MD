25 Custom Heightmap Brushes﻿

﻿Hey everyone!
I've made a collection of heightmap brushes that you can use in things like WorldPainter

All brushes are 100% custom made by myself in WorldMachine.

﻿
This pack contains:﻿
4 Sharp Ridged brushes
4 Fractured Erosion brushes (2 variations of one brush)
4 Curved Norway brushes
4 Billowy Mountain brushes
2 Bulky Mountain brushes
2 Cell Cliff brushes
2 Hill Brushes (2 variations of each)


This is my first brush pack, but I'll most likely post more packs later!
Hope you enjoy them!






You can use these brushes however you like. For commercial use or not. Only thing I ask you not to do, is redistribute them as "your own" brushes :D
